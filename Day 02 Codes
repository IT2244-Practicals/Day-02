Operating Systems - IT2244
Day 02 – Practical Log (16th March 2025)
----------------------------------------

Connecting to a Remote Server using PuTTY
Here’s how I connected to the server during our practical:

1. Launching PuTTY – I searched for PuTTY on my system and opened the application.
2. Entering Server Details – I typed in the server IP address: 172.16.140.150
3. Connecting to the Server – After entering the IP, I clicked Open.
4. Logging In – I logged in using my username and the password (password input is hidden while typing).
5. Server Access Granted – Once authenticated, I successfully accessed the server terminal.

Basic Linux Commands I Practiced
--------------------------------

pwd – Displays the present working directory. Example output when logged in: /home/username

ls – Lists files and directories in the current directory.
Options:
- ls -l → shows detailed file info
- ls -a → shows hidden files

ls -ltr – Sorted listing in long format by modification time (oldest first).
Example Output:
total 5
lrwxrwxrwx  bin -> /home/User/.local/bin
-rwxrwxr--+ Names.txt~
-r-xr--rwx+ Names.txt
-rw-rwxr--+ New.txt
-rw-rwxr--+ New1.txt
-rw-rwxr--+ New2.txt
-rw-rwxr--+ days.sh
-rw-rwxr--+ vi

Creating and Editing Files
--------------------------

Creating an empty file:
touch abc.txt

Opening a file in Vi editor:
vi filename.txt
- Press i to start typing
- Press Esc then type :wq to save and exit

Sample content added using vi acd.txt:
John 32 Engineer
Jane 22 Student
Bob 33 Doctor
Mary 25 Teacher
Alice 32 Nurse

Viewing File Content
--------------------

- more abc.txt – View file content page by page (only forward)
- less abc.txt – Similar to more, but allows forward and backward navigation

CSV File Handling
-----------------

To create a CSV file:
vi pqr.csv

Searching for Files
-------------------

To find a file by name:
find . -name "file.txt"

To find all directories:
find . -type d

To find all CSV files:
find . -name "*.csv"
Output: ./pqr.csv

Counting Lines in a File
------------------------

wc -l filename.txt
Example: wc -l xyz.txt
Output: 1 xyz.txt

Extracting Data from Files
--------------------------

Using cut:
- Get 2nd column: cut -d ',' -f2 pqr.csv
- Get 1st and 3rd columns: cut -d ',' -f1,3 pqr.csv

Using awk:
- Get 1st column: awk -F ',' '{print $1}' pqr.csv

Using head and tail
-------------------

- View first 5 lines: head -n 5 pqr.csv
- View last 2 lines: tail -n 2 pqr.csv

Appending/Extracting Data Between Files
---------------------------------------

Extract 2nd column and append to a new file:
cut -d ',' -f2 pqr.csv >> pqrNew.csv

Append first 3 rows to another file:
head -n 3 pqr.csv >> rows.csv

File Permissions in Linux
-------------------------

Permissions are shown as: -rwxr-xr--
- Owner: rwx (read, write, execute)
- Group: r-x (read, execute)
- Others: r-- (read-only)

Octal representation:
- 777 – Full permissions for all
- 755 – Full for owner, read & execute for group/others
- 644 – Read/write for owner, read-only for group/others
- 700 – Full for owner, none for others

Windows Command Prompt – File Attributes
----------------------------------------

Used ATTRIB to change file attributes:

Steps:
1. Created abc.txt and xyz.txt
2. Hid abc.txt using: ATTRIB +H abc.txt
3. Made it visible again: ATTRIB -H abc.txt
4. Made it read-only: ATTRIB +R abc.txt
